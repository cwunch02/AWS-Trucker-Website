# AWS Trucker Capstone Project

This project only contains the SRC for javascript files for the website that ran through AWS.
Due to the way React apps work, only the javascript files will be provided to show coding throughout the app.
I wrote the code for the login service through Cognito and some of the UI work within the app.
I would like to note I did not work on any SQL backend stuff here but I later did some in a class taken in the summer of 2024.

I would like to credit the rest of my team members here:

Matthew Malak, Evan Chapman, Gabe Volheim
